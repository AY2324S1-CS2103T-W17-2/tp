## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/status/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/status/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/status/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `InternApplicationListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/status/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `InternApplication` object residing in the
  `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/status/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `InternTrackerParser` object which in
   turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a internApplication).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `InternTrackerParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser`
  (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other
  classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`)
  which the `InternTrackerParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/status/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the intern tracker data i.e., all `InternApplication` objects (which are contained in a
  `UniqueApplicationList`
  object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `InternApplication` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate
  _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<InternApplication>` that
  can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the 
  data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a
* `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the 
`InternTracker`, which `InternApplication` references. This allows `InternTracker` to only require one `Tag` 
object per 
unique tag, instead of each `InternApplication` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/status/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both intern tracker data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into
  corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Click InternApplication Card

#### Implementation

The mechanism for the Card click is implemented by creating a new TextArea widget beside the InternApplicationListPanel
and a handler function to handle the event of a card click.

The following classes are created:
* `SelectView` - A class representation of the SelectView Text Area that is to display the details of the card

The new method is:
* `SelectView#displayDetails(String details))` - sets the String details as text in the TextArea
* `Messages#formatDisplay(InternApplication internApplication)` - returns a customised string summarising the details of the InternApplication
* `SelectView#handleCardClick()` - extracts out the details from the InternApplication object and sets it to the SelectView widget


The following method is renamed:
* `Messages#format(InternApplication internApplication)` is renamed to `Messages#formatDisplay(InternApplication internApplication)` - returns the feedback from an executed command


The following sequence diagram shows how Card Click feature:

<puml src="diagrams/SelectViewSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="SelectViewSequenceDiagram" />


#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: How feedback and details are returned from CommandResult**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Separate feedback and details into 2 separate strings `feedbackToUser` and `detailsToUser`.
    * Pros: Clearer and intuitive for future developers to know the content which each string parameter should contain.
    * Cons: Additional parameters in the arguments might make code look complicated.
* **Alternative 2:** Have the feedback String contain the content for both feedbackToUser and detailsToUser through parsing.
      * Pros: Easier to implement.
      * Cons: Requires future developers working on the code to be mindful of how the String input should be structured for successful parsing

###  House-keep feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed mechanism is facilitated by the delete button widget below SelectView and Deadlines feature. 
Additionally, it modifies the following operations:

* `InternApplicationUtiltyButton#handleDeleteClick()`â€‰â€”â€‰Deletes all entries in the list that is older than 1 year compared to present time.

The following sequence diagram shows how the sort operation works:

<puml src="diagrams/HousekeepSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="HousekeepSequenceDiagram" />


#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: How house-keep is done**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a handler function that iterates through each InternApplication in the list and invokes a `DeleteCommand#execute()` if the predicate is satisfied.
    * Pros: Lesser coupling
    * Cons: There is a need to figure out how to make it so the feedback of the DeleteCommand is not shown in ResultDisplay widget.
* **Alternative 2:** Create a handler function that directly calls onto the `Model#deleteInternApplication()` if the predicate passes.
    * Pros: Easier to implement
    * Cons: Increase in coupling and dependencies from the Model class

    
### Undo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedInternTracker`. It extends `InternTracker` with an
undo history, stored internally as a stack `savedStates`. Additionally, it implements the
following operations:

* `VersionedInternTracker#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current intern tracker state in its history.
* `VersionedInternTracker#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous intern tracker state from its history.

VersionedInternTracker#undo() is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#undoAction()`

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedInternTracker` will be
initialized with an empty `savedStates`.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoState0.puml" alt="UndoState0" />

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th internApplication in the intern tracker.
The `delete` command calls `Model#deleteInternApplication()`, which calls `VersionedInternTracker#commit()
`, adding a copy of the current `internApplications` to `savedStates` before carrying out the delete action.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoState1.puml" alt="UndoState1" />

Step 3. The user executes `add n/Google â€¦â€‹` to add a new internApplication. The `add` command calls
`Model#add()` which also calls `VersionedInternTracker#commit()`, adding a copy of the current `internApplications`
to `savedStates` before carrying out the add action.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoState2.puml" alt="UndoState2" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `VersionedInternTracker#commit()`, so the
`internApplications` state will not be added to `savedStates`.

</box>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the internApplication was a mistake, and decides to undo that action
by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which pops the latest
`internApplications` state from `savedStates` and assigns it to the current internApplications.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoState3.puml" alt="UndoState3" />


<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the size of `savedStates` is 0, meaning the stack is empty, then there are no previous
internApplications states to restore. The `undo` command calls `VersionedInternTracker#undo()`, which returns
False if there are no states to restore, and displays a message to the user that the latest change has already
been reached.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the intern tracker,
such as `list`, will usually not call `VersionedInternTracker.commit()`, `Model#undoAction()`
Thus, the `savedStates` remains unchanged.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoState4.puml" alt="UndoState4" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<puml src="diagrams/CommitActivityDiagram.puml" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire intern tracker.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the internApplication being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

**Aspect: How history is implemented:**

* **Alternative 1:** Using a list and pointer to implement version control
    * Pros: Will allow for more features command
    * Cons: Uses more memory than a stack, as saved states are still stored after undo.

* **Alternative 2:** Store the complementary command for each action in the stack
    * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `add`, just save the corresponding `delete`).
    * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of complementing each individual command are correct.
