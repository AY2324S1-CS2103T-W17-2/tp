### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** above provides a high-level overview of the
application's architecture.

Below, you'll find a concise summary of the main components and their
interactions.

#### Main Components of Architecture

**`Main`** (comprising classes
[`Main`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W17-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/letsgethired/Main.java)
and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W17-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/letsgethired/MainApp.java)
is responsible for launching and shutting down the application.

* On app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence,
  and establishes connections between them.
* During shutdown, it closes other components and triggers cleanup operations
  when necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): Handles the interaction with User.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): Executes user commands.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Manages the in-memory data of the app.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Handles reading and writing of data to
  the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) encompasses a set of classes shared across
multiple components.

#### How Architecture Components Interact

The **Sequence Diagram** below illustrates the interactions between components
when the user issues the delete 1 command.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four primary components (as depicted in the diagram above),

* Defines its *API* through an `interface` bearing the same name as the
  component.
* Implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager`
  class that follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the
  previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface
and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which
adheres to the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given
component through its *interface* rather than the concrete class.
The reason for this practice is to decouple outside components from the
internal implementation of the component.
This decoupling is illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

For more comprehensive details on each component, please refer to the
sections below.

### UI Component

**API**:
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W17-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/letsgethired/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI component comprises a `MainWindow` composed of various parts, such as the
`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `InternApplicationListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`,
and more.
All of these elements, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the
abstract `UiPart`class which encapsulates common characteristics among classes
representing different parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component leverages the JavaFx UI framework.
The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files located in
`src/main/resources/view`.
For example, the layout of
the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W17-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/letsgethired/ui/MainWindow.java)
is specified
in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W17-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands by interacting with
  the [`Logic` component](#logic-component).
* Monitors changes in the data within the `Model` to update the UI
  accordingly.
* Maintains a reference to the `Logic` component, since the `UI` relies on
  it for command execution.
* Depends on certain classes within the `Model` component, as it
  displays `InternApplication` objects residing in the `Model`.

### Logic Component

**API**:
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W17-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/letsgethired/logic/Logic.java)

The class diagram below provides a *partial* view of the `Logic` component.

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"></puml>

To illustrate the interactions within the `Logic` component, we'll use the
`execute("delete 1")` API call as an example in the sequence diagram below:

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command"></puml>

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` and `DeleteCommand`
should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation in PlantUML,
the lifeline extends to the end of the diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to
   an `InternTrackerParser` object.
   The `InternTrackerParser` then creates a specific parser (
   e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`)
   tailored to match and parse the command.
2. This results in the creation of a `Command` object, specifically an object
   of one of its subclasses (e.g. `DeleteCommand`).
   This command is then executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The executed command may interact with the `Model` when it is executed,
   such as to delete an `InternApplication` object from the `Model`.
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult`
   object which is returned by `Logic`.

In addition to the class diagram above,
there are other classes (omitted from the class diagram above)
within the Logic component that are used for parsing user commands:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"></puml>

How commands are parsed:

* When called upon to parse a user command, the `InternTrackerParser` class
  creates an `XYZCommandParser`
  (where `XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name
  e.g., `AddCommandParser`).
  The `XYZCommandParser` then uses the other classes shown above to parse
  the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`).
  This `XYZCommand` is then returned as a `Command` object by
  the `InternTrackerParser`.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (
  e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from
  the `Parser` interface, allowing them to be treated similarly where possible,
  especially during testing.

### Model Component

**API**:
[`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W17-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/letsgethired/model/Model.java)

The class diagram below provides an overview of the `Model` component:

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450"></puml>

The `Model` component has the following responsibilities:

* Stores the intern tracker data, which includes all `InternApplication`
  objects.
  These objects are stored in a `UniqueApplicationList` container.
* Maintains a separate filtered, sorted list of 'selected'
  `InternApplication` objects, which is exposed to outsiders as an
  unmodifiable `ObservableList<InternApplication>`.
  This list can be observed, allowing the UI to automatically update
  when its contents change (e.g. after a `find` or `sort` command).
* Stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is
  exposed as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` object.
* Importantly , the `Model` does not depend on any of the other 3 components
  (`UI`, `Logic`, `Storage`).
  Since the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, it's designed
  to stand independently of the other components.

### Storage Component

**API**:
[`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W17-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/letsgethired/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550"></puml>

The `Storage` component,

* Can save both intern tracker data and user preference data in JSON format
* Read data from JSON files and convert them into corresponding objects within
  the application.
* Inherits from both `InternTrackerStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which allows
  it to be used as either one, depending on the functionality needed.
* Depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage`
  component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`).

### Common Classes

Classes that are used across multiple components are located within the
`seedu.letsgethired.commons` package.
These common classes served as shared utilities and functionalities that
contribute to the application's overall functionality.

For example, the `seedu.letsgethired.commons.util.StringUtil` class provides
commonly used string manipulation methods.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Noteworthy Feature Implementations**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are
implemented.

### Add Command

The `add` command enables users to add new internship application into the
Intern Tracker.

#### Implementation

Adding a new internship application involves executing the `AddCommand`.

* The `AddCommand` is parsed by the `AddCommandParser`.
* `AddCommandParser#parse()` parses the user input and returns an `AddCommand`
  object for execution.

Given below is an example usage scenario outlining how the `add` command
behaves at each step.

**Step 1.** The user executes

```shell
`add n/Jane Street r/Full Stack Developer c/Summer 2024`
```

This command adds a new `InternshipApplication` into the `InternTracker`.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** Some fields for the `add` command are optional. For more information
on the `add` command, refer to
the [User Guide](UserGuide.md#adding-your-new-internship-application-add).
</box>

**Step 2.** The `AddCommandParser` parses the arguments, ensuring that
compulsory fields are present and valid.
It then creates a new `InternApplication` object with all the provided fields
and returns an `AddCommand` object containing the
`InternApplication` object ready to be added to the `Model`.

**Step 3.** The `AddCommand#execute()` method is invoked by the `LogicManager`.
The `AddCommand#execute()` calls the `Model#addInternApplication` method to add
the newly created `InternApplication` object to the `Model`.

**Step 4.** The `AddCommand#execute()` method returns a new `CommandResult`
object that contains feedback and display messages for the user.
This result is then handed back to the `LogicManager`.

The sequence diagram below shows the process of adding a new internship
application:

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The input for the `AddCommand` has been truncated for brevity.

</box>

<puml src=diagrams/AddSequenceDiagram.puml></puml>

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `AddCommandParser` and `AddCommand`
should end at the destroy marker (X)
but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Criteria for a identifying duplicate internship application entry:

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** The combination of
  (`COMPANY_NAME`, `ROLE` and `CYCLE`) must be unique.
    * Pros: Allow users to add an internship application to the same company for
      different roles or during different cycles.
    * Cons: Users are required to input additional compulsory fields.
* **Alternative 2:** Enforce uniqueness based only on `COMPANY_NAME`
    * Pros: Allow users to add a new internship application quickly.
    * Cons: It restricts users to having only 1 internship application with a
      given company.

### Find Command

The `find` command enables the users to search internship applications by
looking up a keyword in any of the fields associated with
an internship application.

#### Implementation

Performing a `Find` operation involves executing the `FindCommand.

* The `FindCommand` is parsed by the `FindCommandParser`.
* `FindCommandParser#parse()` parses the user input to return a `FindCommand`
  object that will be executed.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the mechanism behaves at each
step.

**Step 1.** The user keys in the command word to find an internship
application, `find`.

```shell
find n/Jane c/Summer
```

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** At least one field to be searched and the respective keyword
for searching should be provided.

</box>


**Step 2.**
The `FindCommandParser` will execute to get the field and keyword pairs
using the `ArgumentTokenizer`.
The parser creates a new `CompanyContainsFieldKeywordsPredicate` object,
which acts as a predicate that will be used to obtain a filtered list of
internship applications that have the specified keywords in respective fields.
The parser returns a `FindCommand` object with
the `Predicate<InternApplication>`, specifically the
`CompanyContainsFieldKeywordsPredicate`.

**Step 3.** The `FindCommand#execute()` method is invoked by the `LogicManager`.
The `FindCommand` calls the
`Model#updateFilteredInternApplicationList()` to update the filtered internship
application list using the
`Predicate<InternApplication>`, and then
the `Model#getFilteredInternApplicationList()` to obtain the filtered, sorted
internship application list.

**Step 4.** Finally, the `FindCommand` creates a `CommandResult` object that
contains feedback and displays the filtered internship application list to the
user.
The result is then returned to the `LogicManager`.

The sequence diagram below shows the process of finding internship applications.

<puml src="diagrams/FindCommandSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Find Command Sequence Diagram"></puml>

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `FindCommandParser` and `FindCommand`
should end at the destroy marker (X)
but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

### Note Command

The note command enables the users to add or delete notes to an internship
application.

#### Implementation

To add or delete a `Note`, the `NoteCommand` must be executed.

It is worth noting that the NoteCommand is implemented differently from the
other Commands.

<puml src="diagrams/NoteCommandClassDiagram.puml" alt="Note Insert Command Class Diagram"></puml>

From the above class diagram, the `NoteCommand` is an abstract class that is
inherited by the `NoteInsertCommand` class
and the `NoteDeleteCommand` class. This is done so that
the `NoteCommand#execute()` method can behave accordingly while
still having both `NoteCommand` classes share the command word that is 'note'.

The `NoteCommand` is parsed by
the `NoteCommandParser`.`NoteCommandParser#parse()` parses the user input to
return
either a `NoteInsertCommand` or a `NoteDeleteCommand` object that will be
executed.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the mechanism behaves at each
step for **note addition**.

**Step 1.** The user keys in the command word to add a note, `note`.

```shell
note 1 i/Need to revise Rust
```

This command appends the note to the internship application with the index `1`.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The `INDEX` for the `note` command is compulsory.
The `i/` prefix is compulsory for adding a note, and cannot appear at the same
time as the `o/` prefix for deleting a note.
For more information on the `note` command, refer to the
[User Guide](UserGuide.md#adding-notes-to-your-internship-application--note).
</box>

**Step 2** The `NoteCommandParser` parses the arguments, ensuring that
the compulsory fields are present.
In particular, the parser checks that the `i/` prefix is present **and**
the `o/` prefix is absent.
The parser then returns a `NoteInsertCommand` object containing the` Note`
object ready to be added into `Model`

**Step 3.** The `NoteCommand#execute()` method is invoked by the `LogicManager`.
The `NoteCommand#execute()`
method creates a new `InternshipApplication` with the note appended to its
`ArrayList` of notes.

**Step 4.** The `NoteCommand` calls the `Model#setInternApplication()`
and `Model#updateFilteredInternApplicationList()`
methods to add the new internship application with the note to the model, and
replace the old internship application.

**Step 5.** The `NoteCommand` creates a `CommandResult` object that contains the
feedback and `InternApplication` to the user,
which is returned to the `LogicManager`.

The sequence diagram below shows the process of adding a note:

<puml src="diagrams/NoteInsertCommandSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Note Insert Command Sequence Diagram"></puml>

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `NoteCommandParser` and `NoteInsertCommand`
should end at the destroy marker (X)
but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

---

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the mechanism behaves at each
step for **note deletion**.

**Step 1.** The user keys in the command word to add a note, `note`.

```shell
note 1 o/2
```

This command deletes the note with index `2` from the internship application
with index `1`.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The `INDEX` for the `note` command is compulsory.
The `o/` prefix is compulsory for deleting a note, and cannot appear at the same
time as the `i/` prefix for adding a note.
For more information on the `note` command, refer to the
[User Guide](UserGuide.md#deleting-a-note).
</box>

**Step 2.** The `NoteCommandParser` parses the arguments and ensures
that the compulsory fields are present.
In particular, the parser needs to check if the `o/` prefix
is present **and** the `i/` prefix is absent.
The parser then returns a `NoteDeleteCommand` object with the `Index` of the
object to be deleted from the `Model`.

**Step 3.** The `NoteCommand#execute()` method is called by the `LogicManager`.
The `NoteCommand#execute()`
method creates a new `InternshipApplication` with the corresponding note removed
from its `ArrayList` of notes.

**Step 4.** The `NoteCommand` calls the `Model#setInternApplication()`
and `Model#updateFilteredInternApplicationList()`
methods to add the new internship application with the note to the model, and
replace the old internship application.

**Step 5.** The `NoteCommand` creates a `CommandResult` object that contains
feedback and `InternApplication` to the user,
which is returned to the `LogicManager`.

The sequence diagram below shows the process of deleting a note.

<puml src="diagrams/NoteDeleteCommandSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Note Delete Command Sequence Diagram"></puml>

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `NoteCommandParser` and `NoteDeleteCommand`
should end at the destroy marker (X)
but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

### Sort Command

The `sort` command enables the users to sort the internship applications by
a specific field.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** This implementation does not allow for sorting by multiple fields.

</box>

#### Implementation

To introduce the `sort` feature, we make the following changes to the codebase:

1. **Extension of the Model Interface**: We enhance the `Model` interface to
   include a new method:
    * `Model#updateFilteredSortedInternApplicationList(Comparator<InternApplication> comparator))`
    * This method sorts the intern application list by the given comparator.

2. **ModelManager Enhancements**: In the `ModelManager` class, we wrap the
   existing `filteredInternApplications` in a
   JavaFX `SortedList` to create a new `filteredSortedInternApplications` field.
   This new field, allows us to sort the intern applications to be displayed
   based on the specified comparator.

3. **Update existing methods:
    * `Model#getFilteredInternApplicationList()` is updated to return
      the filtered and/or sorted intern application list.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** JavaFX's `SortedList` class extends the `ObservableList` class, which
ensures that any changes made to either the `FilteredList` or the original
`UniqueApplicationList` will automatically propagate to the UI.

</box>


To understand how these changes are integrated into the application, refer to
the sequence diagram below:

<puml src="diagrams/SortSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="SortSequenceDiagram"></puml>

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `SortCommandParser` and `SortCommand`
should end at the destroy marker (X)
but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: How sorting is done**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Wrap the existing `FilteredList` in
  a `SortedList`.
    * Pros: More flexible, as we can both sort and filter without modifying the
      original `UniqueApplicationList`.
* **Alternative 2:** Sort the applications in the `UniqueApplicationList` in
  the `InternTracker`.
    * Cons: Requires us to revert the sorting done by
      the `UniqueApplicationList` before saving the data to
      preserve the initial order in which the intern applications are added.

**Aspect: Comparator**

* **Alternative 1:** Use a `Comparator<InternApplication>` object.
    * Pros: More flexible, as we can sort the intern applications by different
      comparators.
    * Cons: Requires us to create a new `Comparator<InternApplication>` object
      for each sorting operation.
    * Difficult to test for functional equality, as `equals()` method
      for `Comparator` only tests for referential equality.
* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Wrap the comparator in
  an `InternApplicationComparator` class
    * Pros: Allows us to reuse the same comparator for different sorting
      operations, which makes it easier to test for equality.
    * Allows us to strictly define which comparators are allowed.

**Aspect: How feedback and details are returned from CommandResult**

### Undo Command

#### Implementation

The undo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedInternTracker`. It
extends `InternTracker` and maintains an undo history internally as a
stack named `savedStates`.

Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedInternTracker#commit()`â€” Saves the current intern tracker state in
  its history.
* `VersionedInternTracker#undo()`â€” Restores the previous intern tracker state
  from its history.

VersionedInternTracker#undo() is exposed in the `Model` interface
as `Model#undoAction()`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo mechanism behaves at
each step.

**Step 1.** The user launches the application.
The `VersionedInternTracker` will be initialized with an empty `savedStates`.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoState0.puml" alt="UndoState0"></puml>

**Step 2.** The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th
internApplication
from the intern tracker.
The `delete` command calls `Model#deleteInternApplication()`, which
calls `VersionedInternTracker#commit()`,
capturing a copy of the current `internApplications` to `savedStates` before
executing the delete action.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoState1.puml" alt="UndoState1"></puml>

**Step 3.** The user adds a new internship application.

```shell
add n/Google r/Software Engineer c/Summer 2024
```

The `add` command calls `Model#add()` which also calls
`VersionedInternTracker#commit()`,
adding a copy of the current `internApplications` to `savedStates`
before executing the add action.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoState2.puml" alt="UndoState2"></puml>

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command execution fails, the
`internApplications` state will not be added to `savedStates`
(i.e. `VersionedInternTracker#commit()` will not be called).

</box>

**Step 4.** The user now decides that adding the internApplication was a
mistake,
and decides to undo that action
by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will
call `Model#undoAction()`, which pops the latest
`internApplications` state from `savedStates` and assigns it to the current
internApplications.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoState3.puml" alt="UndoState3"></puml>


<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the size of `savedStates` is 0, meaning the stack is empty, then
there are no previous
internApplications states to restore. The `undo` command
calls `VersionedInternTracker#undo()`, which returns
False if there are no states to restore, and displays a message to the user that
the latest change has already been reached.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram"></puml>

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X)
but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

**Step 5.** The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that
do
not modify the intern tracker,
such as `list`, will usually not
call `VersionedInternTracker.commit()`, `Model#undoAction()`
Thus, the `savedStates` remains unchanged.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoState4.puml" alt="UndoState4" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a
new command:

<puml src="diagrams/CommitActivityDiagram.puml" width="600"></puml>

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire intern tracker.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage, especially
      if many operations are carried out.

* **Alternative 2:** Implement an `undo` operation
  for each individual command.
    * Pros: This method conserves memory (e.g. for `delete`, it only saves the
      `internApplication` being deleted).
    * Cons: It requires updating the interface for `Command` and an
      implementation for each individual command.

**Aspect: How history is implemented:**

* **Alternative 1:** Using a list and pointer to implement version control
    * Pros: Will allow for more feature-rich commands, such as `redo`.
    * Cons: Uses more memory than a stack, as saved states are still stored
      after the undo operation.

* **Alternative 2:** Store the saved state in a stack
    * Pros: Will use less memory, as saved states are popped off the stack
      after `undo`.

### Click InternApplication Card

This feature allows the user to click on an `InternApplicationCard` in the
`InternApplicationListPanel`to display the details of the `InternApplication`.

#### Implementation

The Card click mechanism is implemented by creating a GridPane beside
the `InternApplicationListPanel`
and a listener function to handle the event of a card click. The GridPane
notably comprises 1 `TextArea` for notes
and 5 `TextFields` for other details of an Intern Application

The following class is created:

* `SelectView` - This class represents the panel responsible for displaying the
  details of the card.

The following methods are added:

* `SelectView#displayDetails(InternApplication internApplication))` -
  sets each details in the intern application in each corresponding `TextField`
  or `TextArea`.
* `SelectView#clearDetails()` -
  clears all contents in the SelectView `TextField` or `TextArea`.
* `InternApplicationListPanel#setSelectedItemListener()` -
  adds a listener method to the `ListView` model that calls
  the `SelectView#displayDetails()` whenever a different
  item on the list is selected
* `InternApplicationListPanel#getSelectedItemIndex()` -
  returns the index of the currently selected item in the ListView

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the mechanism behaves at each
step.

**Step 1.** The user clicks on the intern application card he wants to view.

**Step 2** The ChangeListener that was set into the ListView triggers from the
event and executes
a method to execute `view INDEX` where INDEX is the corresponds to the item's
relative index on the list.

**Step 3.** The `Logic` creates a `CommandResult` object from
the `ViewCommand#execute()`. The `CommandResult` contains
a String feedback and `InternApplication` to the user.

**Step 4.** The `InternApplication` in the `CommandResult` is then passed into
the
`SelectView#displayDetails(InternApplication internApplication))` where each
field in the intern application is
displayed in its respective `TextArea` or `TextField`.

The following sequence diagram high level view of how the Card Click feature
works:

<puml src="diagrams/SelectViewSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="SelectViewSequenceDiagram"></puml>

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: What data type should displayDetails take in:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** InternApplication Object.
    * Pros: Easy to implement. We can just extract individual values from the
      object without needing to parse a string
    * Cons: Added dependency of InternApplication in
      both `InternApplicationListPanel` and `SelectView`

* **Alternative 2:** String containing all field data in the involved
  InternApplication Object
    * Pros: Reduce coupling between `InternApplicationList`, `SelectView`,
      and `InternApplication`
    * Cons: Requires an additional step of parsing, which makes code much more
      complex.

## **Appendix: Effort**

In crafting LetsGetHired, a lot of thought was put into delivering a
user-centric application that
simplifies internship application tracking. We prioritized user experience with
a revamped GUI and enhanced
internship application organization through features like sort and find. We also
provided users the
flexibility to attach helpful information to entries, through the introduction
of notes.

### Designing Organisation Features

Designing organizational features in LetsGetHired, such as the Find and Sort
commands, presented a notable
advancement beyond the capabilities of AB3. While AB3 exclusively features a
basic Find function that
searches for entries based on matching keywords to names in the address book, in
LetsGetHired, the Find
command empowers users to conduct searches across various fields associated with
internship applications
simultaneously. Additionally, we took it one step further, enhancing the Find
command in LetsGetHired
to accommodate partial matches, giving our users more flexibility and freedom.

The introduction of the Sort command in LetsGetHired stands as another milestone
in organizational design.
LetsGetHired enables users to sort their internship applications in ascending or
descending
order based on any field. This functionality provides users with the ability to
customize the
organization of their application.

### Developing a Better User Interface

We undertook a substantial overhaul of the GUI in LetsGetHired, distinguishing
it from the interface of
AB3. LetsGetHired embraces a visually appealing GUI that facilitates in-depth
exploration of application
details through a select view. This transition required intricate design
decisions to seamlessly integrate
additional functionalities for detailed application viewing and adding of notes
that demand larger screen
real estate. In our commitment to user experience, we also interactivity with
the GUI through an ability
to view applications from the list view by clicking on the corresponding card.

### Designing Notes Functionality

Notes play an integral part in LetsGetHired, allowing users to add many pieces
of information associated
with an internship application. We deliberated on how notes should be created,
viewed, deleted and integrated
into LetsGetHired's existing and future functionalities, such as searching for
an application by notes.
This addition allowed us to introduce another dimension to LetsGetHired, adding
depth and nuance to the
application management experience.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

### Improved Command Error Feedback

**Current Implementation**: In the current version of our application, when a
user inputs a command with missing compulsory fields, the application responds
with a generic error message: `Invalid Command Format!`. This is followed by the
correct usage of the command. While this approach informs the user of an error,
it lacks specificity in identifying the exact cause of the error, particularly
which compulsory field(s) are missing.

**Planned Enhancement**: We aim to improve user experience and error feedback by
implementing a more detailed error reporting system. This enhancement will
enable the application to not only detect that an invalid command has been
entered but also identify and highlight the specific missing compulsory fields.

**Proposed Changes**:

* **Error Detection Algorithm**: Modify the command parsing algorithm to include
  checks for each compulsory field. This will enable the system to pinpoint
  which field(s) the user failed to provide.

* **User Feedback Enhancement**: When a command is identified as invalid due to
  missing fields, the application will generate a tailored error message. This
  message will specifically list the missing compulsory field(s), guiding the
  user to correct the specific mistake. For example, if a user forgets to input
  the `CYCLE` field in a command, the error message would
  be: `Invalid Command Format! Missing field: CYCLE`. This message will be
  followed by the correct usage of the command.

**Expected Benefits**:

* **Improved User Experience**: By providing specific feedback on missing
  fields, users can more easily understand and rectify their mistakes, leading
  to a smoother interaction with the application.
* **Increased Efficiency**: This enhancement reduces the time and effort users
  spend in deciphering generic error messages and figuring out what went wrong.
* **Enhanced Usability**: Tailored error messages make the application more
  user-friendly, especially for new users who are still familiarizing themselves
  with the command syntax.

### Improved Unknown Command Error Feedback

**Current Implementation**: In the current version of our application, when a
user inputs an unrecognized command, the system simply displays a
message: `Unknown Command`. This response, while accurate, does not assist the
user in understanding why the command was unrecognized or how to correct it.

**Planned Enhancement**: We plan to introduce a more intuitive error handling
mechanism for unknown commands, akin to the approach used in Git. This
enhancement will involve suggesting commands similar to the user's input, which
can be particularly useful in cases where the user has made a typing error.

**Proposed Changes**:

* **Command Suggestion Algorithm**: Implement an algorithm that detects and
  suggests similar commands when an unknown command is entered. For example, if
  a user mistakenly types `ad` instead of `add`, the system will suggest the
  correct command: `Unknown Command: 'ad'. Did you mean 'add'?`.

* **Synonym Recognition**: Enhance the command parsing logic to recognize
  synonyms or commonly used alternatives for certain commands. For instance, if
  a user types `search` or `filter` instead of `find`, the application could
  respond with a suggestion: `Unknown Command: 'search'. Do you mean 'find'?`.

**Expected Benefits**:

* **Enhanced User Assistance**: By providing relevant command suggestions, users
  can quickly rectify typing errors or understand alternative terminology used
  within the application.
* **Increased Efficiency**: This enhancement reduces the time and effort users
  spend in deciphering generic error messages and figuring out what went wrong.
* **Improved Usability for New Users**: New users, unfamiliar with specific
  command syntax, will find the application more approachable with these
  intuitive prompts and suggestions.

### Improved Visibility of Newly Added Internship Applications

**Current Implementation**: In the current version of our application, when a
new internship application is added to our list, it is placed at the bottom.
This positioning often renders the new entry outside the user's current view,
requiring them to manually scroll down to locate the latest addition.

**Planned Enhancement**: We are planning to enhance the user experience by
changing how newly added internship applications are displayed. The key
improvement will be automatically scrolling the list to bring the newly added
application into view immediately. Additionally, we are considering placing new
entries at the top of the list rather than at the bottom.

**Proposed Changes**:

* **Automatic Scrolling**: Modify the list view functionality to automatically
  scroll to the position of the newly added internship application. This ensures
  that the latest entry is immediately visible to the user without requiring
  manual navigation.

* **List Ordering Modification**: Change the default order of the list to
  display new applications at the top. This approach aligns with common user
  expectations, where the most recent items are readily accessible.

**Expected Benefits**:

* **Improved Visibility of New Applications**: By immediately showcasing new
  applications, users can immediately see and interact with the most recent
  entries, improving workflow efficiency.
* **Adaptation to User Preferences**: Adjusting the list order to display new
  items at the top aligns with common user behavior and expectations, thereby
  improving usability.
* **Enhanced User Experience**: Automatically scrolling to new entries saves
  time and improves the overall user experience, making the application more
  intuitive and efficient.

### Sorting by Multiple Fields

**Current Implementation**: In the current version of our application, the
application only allows sorting of internship applications by
ONE field at a time using parameters such as `c/a` for sorting by cycles in
ascending order or `n/d` for sorting by company names in descending order.

**Planned Enhancement**: Enable sorting by multiple fields to enhance the
flexibility of data organization. This improvement addresses the limitation of
the current sorting functionality, allowing users to sort data by more than one
criterion at a time. For example, users should be able to sort first by cycle in
ascending order and then by company name in ascending order using the following
command:

```shell
sort c/a n/a
```

This means that if 2 internship applications have the same cycle, for example
`Summer 2024`, they will be sorted by company name in ascending order
(`Apple` before `Google`).

**Proposed Changes**:

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The `InternApplicationComparator` class already contains a
`createCompositeComparator()` method that can be used to combine multiple
`InternApplication` comparators into a single comparator.
</box>

- Update `ArgumentTokenizer` to parse the order of prefixes.
- Update `SortCommandParser` to allow for multiple sorting criteria.

**Expected Benefits**:

- Users can organise internship applications more precisely by specifying
  multiple sorting criteria.
- Enhanced user experience with the ability to customise internship application
  sorting based on specific needs.
- Improved usability for users who require complex sorting for internship
  application analysis.

### Enhanced Version Control: Redo

**Current Implementation**: In the current version of our application, users are
able to undo changes made
using the Undo command. This allows users to revert formerly destructive
commands, for a more forgiving and
beginner-friendly experience. We see a redo function as a natural progression
from undo, where users will be
given greater agency in managing their internship applications.

**Planned Enhancement**: We plan to implement a Redo command that will allow
users to redo commands that
were undone. This change empowers users to have greater flexibility in managing
their internship
applications by enabling users to toggle between app states with ease.

**Proposed Changes**:

* **Undone States History**: Store undone states in a separate history, similar
  to how past states are
  stored currently.

* **Redo Command** : Introduce a new command : Redo, that will redo a command
  that was previously undone
  or notify the user that there are no commands to redo.

**Expected Benefits**:

* **Improved Beginner Experience**: By providing the option to redo, new users
  can have an easier time
  exploring commands and undoing and redoing changes when necessary.
* **Increased Efficiency**: This enhancement allows users to manage their
  applications more efficiently
  and save time in the event of an unintentional undos.

### Default Sort Order

**Current Implementation**: In the current version of our application, when a
user sorts by a particular field, there will be no way for the user to revert 
to the initial sort order. The only way to revert to the default sort order is 
by restarting the app.

**Planned Enhancement**: We plan to introduce a way for users to revert the list
to its default sort order. This enhancement may be particularly useful for users
who which to see the list sorted in the order they added the intern application
entries in.

**Proposed Changes**:

* **Add new ID field into InternApplication class**: The idea behind this change 
  is to mimic the identifier key that is present in most SQL databases. This way,
  we will be able to seamlessly sort the InternApplications according to their ID
  which is the order in which they are added.

* **New ID Class**: The `Id` class will encapsulate the identifier key integer for
  the corresponding `InternApplication`.
  The class will also have a static counter variable to count the total number of
  intern applications that is added while the app is running. This helps to ensure
  that none of the `InternApplication` objects has duplicate key values.
  `Id#generateUseableId()` is a factory method responsible for generating an ID key
  that is not used by any intern applications yet.
  It is also worth noting that the Id value will not be passed into the 
  serialised JSON format as we wish for the keys to be dynamically assigned at every 
  run of the application. This way, it is unlikely for integer overflow in the Id 
  value.

* **SortCommand**: The `SortCommand` class will be changed to behave differently 
  whenever the user enters `sort default` into the CommandBox. The `SortCommandParser` 
  will see that none of the prefixes are present in the input. After which, it will 
  check the preamble. If the preamble contains the string "default", the SortCommand 
  will execute the sort logic to sort by the `Id` class.

**Expected Benefits**:

* **Enhanced Quality of Life**: Users do not have to restart the application just to see
  their list in the default sorted order.
* **Improved Usability for New Users**: By providing a way for users to revert their sorted
  list to the default, it allows them to easily look at the latest entries that they have 
  added.

### Edit Notes

**Current Implementation**: The current version of our application does not
support the feature of editing a particular note in the note list. The only
operations we offer for note management is adding and deleting notes as those
two are most crucial.

**Planned Enhancement**: We plan to make further enhancements to facilitate
editing of notes. This feature will be useful for users as it saves them
the hassle of deleting a note and re-adding it to keep their notes updated.

**Proposed Changes**:

* **New NoteEditCommand Class**: Create a new class called `NoteEditCommand`.
  Similar to the `NoteInsertCommand` and `NoteDeleteCommand`, the 
  `NoteEditCommand` will inherit from the `NoteCommand` class and behave in
  accordance to edit a particular note. The class will require 3 parameters
  in the constructor: The index of the application, the index of the note, 
  and the String input note that the user wants to store.

* **Additional function in InternApplication Class**: An additional function
  is required to represent the behavior that we want in note editing. Namely,
  `InternApplication#editNote()` will take in 2 parameters: The index of the
  note, and the string of input note to be stored. The function makes a copy
  of its immutable list of notes into a mutable one and swaps the `Note` in the 
  specified index input with a newly constructed `Note` from the input string.
  The function then returns a new `InternApplication` with the updated notes.

* **NoteCommandParser Changes**: The current version of our app throws an 
  exception when both `PREFIX_NOTE_DELETE` and `PREFIX_NOTE_INSERT` is detected.
  The proposed change to make way for note editing is to remove the thrown 
  exception line in place of a `NoteEditCommand` object.

**Expected Benefits**:

* **Faster note management for Users**: Editing notes will be reduced from a two
  step process (Note deleting and then Note editing) into a one step process 
  (Note editing)
