**LetsGetHired** is a desktop application designed to assist you in efficiently **tracking and managing** your internship
applications and their progress.

<<<<<<< HEAD
## Unique Features
- **Swift Viewing**: Swiftly view your internship applications and monitor their status.
- **Sort & Filter**: Organize your internship applications for better clarity.
- **Stay Updated**: Stay updated on the progress of each application, from application sent to interview stages.
- **Notes Feature**: Add personalized notes to each internship application entry, ensuring you never forget key details. 
- **Deadlines**: Set and track deadlines for your internship applications, so you never miss an opportunity.

## Optimized Experience
In addition to these capabilities, we recognize the importance of **speed and efficiency**. Thus, **LetsGetHired** is 
optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI), but you still enjoy the advantages of a Graphical User Interface 
(GUI). If you're a swift typist, **LetsGetHired** can streamline your internship tracking faster than many standard 
GUI-based tools available.
