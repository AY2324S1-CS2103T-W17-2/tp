### Project: LetsGetHired

_LetsGetHired_ is a **desktop application** designed to assist you in efficiently **tracking and managing your
internship applications and their progress**.

In addition to these capabilities, we recognize the importance of **speed and efficiency**. Thus, _LetsGetHired_ is
**optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI)**, but you still enjoy the advantages of a Graphical User Interface
(GUI). If you are a swift typist, _LetsGetHired_ can streamline your internship tracking **faster than many standard
GUI-based tools available.**
